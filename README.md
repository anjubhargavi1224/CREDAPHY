Credaphy - A Steganography Project 
Credaphy is a project based on steganography, mainly consisting of encrypting and decrypting of messages using images as the base. In this project we take the image and encryption message from the user and convert the message to binary format and store it in the image we have used the least significant bit algorithm due to this the message is converted to bit format and is stored in the least significant bit of the image that is the bits in the image that will be least affected in terms of color change ,it will store the message in such a way that the image color change will not be visible to the naked human eye. In our project we have used this mechanism in order to produce images that will help the sender to transfer data to the receiver in a more secure manner.![Screenshot 2024-09-18 195020](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1976d72-5590-4920-9ce3-2a5e14c9a092)
